---++ Usage

Just attach =.deb= files to your topics, and you will get valid Debian
repositories for them at =%<nop/>PUBURL%/TheWeb/debian=.

You will get one repository per web.

If you put valid !GnuPG data in the right place on your filesystem, then the
repositories will be signed with !GnuPG, and the public key used to sign the
repository is exported at =%<nop/>PUBURL%/TheWeb/debian/signing-key.asc=

To advertise your repository for others to use, you can use the following
template:

<verbatim>
To install packages from this repository, add the following line to your
=/etc/apt/sources.list= file:

<code>
deb %PUBURL%/%WEB%/debian ./
</code>

Then import the signing key by running the following command:

<code>
$ curl %PUBURL%/%WEB%/debian/signing-key.asc  | sudo apt-key add -
</code>

Then update your package lists with the following command:

<code>
$ sudo apt-get update
</code>

And then install PACKAGE:

<code>
$ sudo apt-get install PACKAGE
</code>
</verbatim>

---+++ Restricting which packages go into the repository

If you want a fine-grained control of which packages go into your web's Debian
repository, you can define the =DEBIAN_REPOSITORY_TOPICS= setting in your web's
WebPreferences topic to a *space separated list of topic names*, like this:

<verbatim>
   * Set DEBIAN_REPOSITORY_TOPICS = Topic1 Topic2
</verbatim>

In that case, %TOPIC% will scan only Topic1's and Topic2' attachment
directories looking for .deb files to include in the repository.

You can gain even more control of what goes into your repository by restricting
the write access to Topic1 and Topic2 using
[[System.AccessControl][Foswiki's access control capabilities]].

---++ Changing the repository directory

By default, this plugin will put the repository files in a directory called
=debian= under the web public directory. If for some reason you need a
different name, set the variable DEBIAN_REPOSITORY_NAME in the WebPreferences
topic. For example, to make the repository in =debian/squeeze= directory, use:

<verbatim>
   * Set DEBIAN_REPOSITORY_NAME = debian/squeeze
</verbatim>

Remember to also replace "debian" with "debian/squeeze" if you copied the
installation instructions template above.

---++ Installation Instructions

%$INSTALL_INSTRUCTIONS%

This plugin requires the apt-ftparchive program to work. This program is part
of the apt-utils packages, and should already be installed in all systems
running Debian GNU/Linux (or derivatives). If for some reason it is not
installed already, then you must install it to make this plugin work for you.

To enable !GnuPG signatures in the generated Debian repositories, you must put
a 'gnupg' directory in the same level as your 'pub' directory
(=$Foswiki::cfg{PubDir}=), containing a valid !GnuPG home directory. You can
generate one by issuing the following commands:

<verbatim>
mkdir /path/to/foswiki/gnupg
gpg --homedir /path/to/foswiki/gnupg --gen-key
chown -R www-data:www-data /path/to/foswiki/gnupg
chmod -R go-rwx /path/to/foswiki/gnupg
</verbatim>

The above commands assume that:

   * =/path/to/foswiki/gnupg= is at the same level as your pub directory. If
     you are using
     [[Foswiki:Extensions/VirtualHostingContrib][VirtualHostingContrib]], you
     can have a per-virtualhost !GnuPG directory at
     =/path/to/foswiki/virtualhost/$VIRTUALHOST/gnupg=.
   * Your web server runs under user =www-data= and group =www-data=, which is
     the case in Debian GNU/Linux. If your system uses other user/group
     combination, please adjust accordingly
